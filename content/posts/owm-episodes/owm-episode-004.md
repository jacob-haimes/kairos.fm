This week Coleman spoke with past Columbia University professor of Microbiology and Public Health Dr. Dickson Despommier. Despommier is a serial author, Ted talk deliverer, and speaker who has given numerous lectures on the role Vertical Farming will play in the future of agriculture and the tremendous threat a lack of innovation and change in our food systems will bring unless we change.
