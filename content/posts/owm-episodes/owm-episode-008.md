This was recorded on Coleman's third day of Cambridge's Conference on Catastrophic Risk 2020.  Which is a conference with the world's leading experts on Global Catastrophic Risk put on by The Centre for the Study of Existential Risk and Cambridge.

This conference was incredible, I am so thankful for the insights and growth into this field that I love talking, reading, and researching so much. Existential Risk is here to stay and is quickly coming into a renaissance of discovery into questions concerning our species survival in the 21st Century. In today's special episode of the 21st Talks, Coleman dives into the lessons from this year's conference and the philosophical and psychological connections that this conference has brought up for him.
