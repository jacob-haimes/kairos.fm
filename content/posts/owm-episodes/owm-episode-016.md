In this episode, Coleman sat down with existential risk ethicists and researcher Dr. SJ Beard from Cambridge's Existential Risk Institute about the far future of humanity, ethical growth through generations, and the psychology behind striving to do the most good. The two also discussed opening the number of possible future worlds and how it connects to motivation to do the work that morally we must this century. 

"We are motivated by what we believe we can achieve, much more than what we think we ought to do." - Dr. SJ Beard
