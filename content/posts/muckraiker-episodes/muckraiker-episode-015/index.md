<div style="text-align: justify">

In this episode, we redefine AI's "reasoning" as mere *rambling*, exposing the "illusion of thinking" and "Potemkin understanding" in current models. We contrast the classical definition of reasoning (requiring logic and consistency) with Big Tech's new version, which is a generic statement about information processing. We explain how Large Rambling Models generate extensive, often irrelevant, *rambling traces* that appear to improve benchmarks, largely due to best-of-N sampling and benchmark gaming.

Words and definitions actually matter! Carelessness leads to misplaced investments and an overestimation of systems that are currently just surprisingly useful autocorrects.
