As a companion to muckrAIkers sixth episode, [US National Security Memorandum on AI, Oct 2024](https://kairos.fm/muckraikers/e006/), we wanted to release a short blogpost summarizing key takeaways from the lengthy document. Perhaps it will be moot in a couple months, but we can still use it to gain insights on how the US government is addressing "AI".

</div>

## A Behemoth Shouldn't Twitch

<div style="text-align: justify">

When large institutions make fundamental changes, the repercussions have potential to be far reaching and unpredictable. The United States government is such an organization, with the military industrial complex budget set at approximately 850 Billion USD for the fiscal year of 2024 [1](https://comptroller.defense.gov/Portals/45/Documents/defbudget/FY2024/FY2024_Budget_Request_Overview_Book.pdf). While the slow speed of the government is a source of great frustration to many, including myself, it in general increases institutional stability, and decreases risk [[2](https://www.govtech.com/pcio/the-slow-government-movement-opinion.html),[3](https://economics.mit.edu/sites/default/files/2022-09/Institutional%20Change%20and%20Institutional%20Persistence.pdf)].

The US National Security Memorandum on AI published on October 24, 2024, along with a [framework](https://ai.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/NSM-Framework-to-Advance-AI-Governance-and-Risk-Management-in-National-Security.pdf) on using AI for national security exemplifies this well; it is a continuation of last year's [Executive Order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2023/10/30/executive-order-on-the-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-development-and-use-of-artificial-intelligence/) on AI, with a specific eye towards national security. Similarly to the first installment, the Executive Branch sets many explicit deadlines for the teams and initiatives that were kicked off last year, and also puts forth a number of directives.

To us muckrAIkers, this memorandum proposes an opportunity to understand how the Biden administration is thinking about AI.

</div>

## Themes

<div style="text-align: justify">

**Safe, secure, and trustworthy AI.** This phrase is repeated frequently throughout the memorandum and framework. We see this as indication that the Biden administration understands these three characteristics are not necessarily the default when it comes to AI.

**Promotion of democratic values.** While it may seem obvious that a document from the President of the United States explicitly calls out the importance of democratic values, but maybe not...

**Utilization of AI.** Government entities are tasked with the incorporation of AI systems into their national security relevant procedures.

</div>

## Prohibited AI Uses

<div style="text-align: justify">

1. No targeting, profiling, or tracking people *solely* for exercising constitutional rights like free speech
2. No interfering with free speech, or access to legal representation
3. No *unlawful* discrimination
4. No *unlawful* sentiment analysis
5. No use of *only* biometric data for profiling
6. No use for military estimates (noncombatant identification) *unless* there is sufficient testing + assurances, and trained human oversight
7. No *final* determination of immigration classification (asylum/US entry)
8. No production of reports based solely on AI outputs, *unless* there is a disclaimer
9. No removal of human oversight from presidential decisions to use nuclear weapons

## Additional Items of Note

<div style="text-align: justify">

**Chips are not neglected.** The importance of advanced computer chips and the chip supply chain has not gone unnoticed.

**Talent is emphasized.** To maintain it's edge, the US will need to remain the go-to destination for technical expertise relevant to AI.

**Presidential reports.** Many groups will be tasked with the preparation of annual reports, to be given directly to the president.

**Blocking foreign acquisition.** One item explicitly states that the United States government may block the sale of an AI company to foreign parties to prevent leakage of items instrumentally useful to the creation and effective use of powerful AI systems.
