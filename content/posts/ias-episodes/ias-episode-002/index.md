In this episode I discuss my initial research proposal for the 2024 Winter AI Safety Camp with one of the individuals who helps facilitate the program, Remmelt Ellen.<br>

{{< transistor src="https://share.transistor.fm/e/57154a54" >}}

The proposal is titled "The Effect of Machine Learning on Bioengineered Pandemic Risk". A doc-capsule of the proposal at the time of this recording can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bbFDNc_hzhzYqN6pn1jYvPhSRp2CyYez4UP0ly_mMRM/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at this link</a>.
