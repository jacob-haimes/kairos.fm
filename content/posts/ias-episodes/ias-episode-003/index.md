### TL;DL

- Starting in early December (2023), I will be uploading episodes on a biweekly basis (day TBD).
- I won't be releasing another episode until then, so that I can build a cache of episodes up.
- During this month (November 2023), I'll also try to get the podcast up on more platforms, set up comments on more platforms, and create an anonymous feedback form.
